It manipulates the data in \nstruct_0 through the pointer v10 based on conditions related to temporary intege\nr variables. Then it assigns various field data of struct_0 to a series of local\n character variables. While not completely clear without context, it seems that \nit might be involved in some bit manipulation, perhaps as a part of a larger pro\ngram. \n\nThe function then appears to make a function call to another function (sub_71dd0\n). It takes as parameters the field_4 of struct_1 and address of the variable v0\n.\nThe function returns no value. It has two return points controlled by the condit\nion of a temporary variable tmp_22.\n"
